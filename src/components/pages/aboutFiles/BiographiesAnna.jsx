            <p><span>Anna</span> began life as a winner - she was voted "baby with the most tuneful wail" in St Whyayeman's Maternity Hospital, Newcastle, in the year of our Lord, none of your business. She had a successful pre-school career as a wombat wrestler, gaining several world titles along the way. Her love of music was the cause of her time at convent school being cut short - that, and the nuns discovering the protection racket she was running with several other, somewhat unsavoury, older girls. Escaping from the school, she joined Abigail Snufflebucket's Travelling Opera Company, and spent the next several years touring the world, to great acclaim. Growing tired of the adoration of some of the world's most eligible millionaires, Anna returned to England and is now studying front end web development: a career she will no doubt excel at. But she will be avoiding jQuery as much as possible.</p>
