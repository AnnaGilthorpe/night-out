            <p><span>Ashley's</span> past is a mix of myth, conjecture, and a sprinkling of legend. If you were to listen to the gossip, you would think Ashley had been everything from a ninja assassin to the Grand Master of The Order of the Knights Templar, with stints as a goat herder, snail farmer and children's party entertainer along the way. What is known for sure is that he was part of a secret brotherhood of vampire hunters, operating for many years in the Carpathians. Some would say successfully. The more clear-sighted might opt for "haphazardly". Either way, they certainly racked up an impressive body count. After hearing the words, "NO, NO, YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG PERSON!" shouted one too many times, Ashley resolved to find a different way of life. His new vocation was revealed to him in a dream one night after eating a large, slightly out of date, block of cheese. He returned home and is now involved in the exciting field of front end web development.</p>
